					SkyWind is a weather app that was built for more development into
					APIs. Search for a city located anywhere in the world to get the
					current weather at that location. Along with the current temperature
					and condition being diplayed the next few hours, every 3, are also
					displayed. Depending on a users geogrpahical location they may use
					differnt units of measument, so I included a toggle switch in order to
					switch between farenhite and celecuis. In order to get the weather
					data I used openweathermaps API service. I wanted to go a step further
					with this project and change the background based on the time in the
					location searched for. The response I got from openweathermaps did not
					include a time for the location but it did include a longitude and
					latitude for that location. I was able to pull out that data and then
					use Googles time zone API service in order to get the exact time of
					that location. This allowed for a dynamic background change based on
					location searched for. As of now SkyWind was specifically made for
					mobile devices so you will either need to view it on a mobile device
					or inspect the page and go to the responsive section for a mobile
					device to view it properly. SkyWind was built using HTML, CSS, Vanilia
					JavaScript, and hosted on Netilfy.
