This is my Developer Portfolio site. It showcases a little about myself as well as the projects that I have worked on.

This was built using standard web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScipt.

At some point in the future I do plan to transition it and change it up some using React.js.

The site can be found at: https://tylercodes.dev/
