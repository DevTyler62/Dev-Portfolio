					A two semester senior capstone group project that followed all of the
					elements of the software development life cycle. The group went
					through the analysis, design, development, and testing phases of the
					project. Buggy is a bug tracking system that was taking issues
					currently found within current bug tracking softwares and
					implmentating them into our software. Thoses issues we discovered as a
					team were that users of other bug tracking systems found the
					interfaces to be diffcult to navigate as well as the fact that there
					was no colloaboration possible on a given ticket. With those issues
					documented we then incorportated an intuitive user interface as well
					as having a disscusion board for each bug report that came through to
					allow for more developer communcation. This project put us in real
					working world enviroment that was was meet with plently of challenges
					along the way. Most notable challenges were that at the beginning the
					group consited of 4 people but one memeber had to leave due to medical
					issues. The group also dealt with being the first class to work in a
					fully remote enviroment for the enitre length of the project. Having
					to deal with each indivuduals schedule while trying to provides the
					best communication possible was demanding. Unfortunaly due to the fact
					that some resources used in the development of buggy that would need
					to be paid for at this point, buggy is no longer a live active site.
					The code is still avaibale to view at the button above. Buggy was
					built using modern technoligies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP,
					MySQL, and Hostinger.
